# NPC drop information
#
# Format:
#  id = {itemid,min,max,droprate}
#
# Example:
#  10 = 2,3,4,0.5, 1,1,10,100
#
# NPC #10 drops between 1 and 10 gold (item #1) 100% of the time,
# and drops between 3 and 4 "item #2"s 0.5% of the time.
#
# The exact meaning of droprate is dependant on the DropRateMode
# configuration option.
#
# It is recommended to create a new file and change the config to point at it
# rather than editing this file.
