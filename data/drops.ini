# NPC drop information
#
# Format:
#  id = {itemid,min,max,droprate}
#
# Example:
#  10 = 1,1,1,100, 2,2,4,0.5
#
# NPC #10 drops between 1 and 1 gold (item #1) 100% of the time,
# and drops between 2 and 4 "item #2"s 0.5% of the time.
#
# The lowest drop rate supported is 0.01%
#
# It is recommended to create a new file and change the config to point at it
# rather than editing this file.
