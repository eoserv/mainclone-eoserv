# Innkeeper/spawn point information
#
# Spawn Point Format:
#  name.name = name
#  name.location = map, x,y
#  name.innkeeper = npcid (optional)
#  name.question[1-3] = question (optional)
#  name.answer[1-3] = snswer (optional)
#
# Level Tier Spawn Format:
#  level.x = name
#
# Example:
#  newbland.name = Wanderer
#  newbland.location = 1, 3,4
#  level.0 = newbland
#
# Creates a spawn point at 3,4 on map 1 called Wanderer for vagabonds.
# Questions and answers are only needed if the innkeeper id is set.
#
# It is recommended to create a new file and change the config to point at it
# rather than editing this file.
