# Shop information
#
# Format:
#  id.name = shop_name
#  id.trade = {item,buy_price,sell_price}
#  id.craft = {item,ingr1,amt,ingr2,amt,ingr3,amt,ingr4,amount}  (optional)
#
# Example:
#  3.name = Potion Shop
#  3.trade = 2,100,200, 3,200,100
#  3.craft = 4,2,5,3,1,0,0,0,0
#
# NPC #3's shop will be called "Potion Shop".
# It will sell "item #2"s for 100g (and buy them for 50g),
# and sell "item #3"s for 200g (and buy them for 100g).
# You can craft "item #4" with 5x "item #2" and 1x "item #3".
#
# The server will warn you if a sell price is higher than a buy price.
#
# It is recommended to create a new file and change the config to point at it
# rather than editing this file.
